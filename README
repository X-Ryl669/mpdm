MPDM (Minimum Profit Data Manager)
==================================

MPDM (Minimum Profit Data Manager) is a lightweight library that provides C
programs with a rich set of useful data types as scalars, dynamic arrays
(i.e. indexed by number) and associative arrays (i.e. indexed by a string
key). Also, it contains a rudimentary garbage collector that alleviates the
need to keep track of data no longer useful, as well as help for operating
system abstraction and portability, regular expressions, string manipulation,
character set conversions, localization, file I/O access, pipes and
multithreading (threads, semaphores and mutexes).
