MPDM Release Notes
==================

1.0.3
-----

 * The hashing function has changed to a less accurate but faster one.
 * There is a new, adaptive way of sweeping: if default_sweep if set
   to a negative value (different from -1), it's used as a divisor
   of the total count of values; this will be the number of values
   that will be swept on each call to mpdm_sweep(0). This way, the
   number of swept values depend on the total count.
 * New functions mpdm_set_ival() and mpdm_set_rval().

1.0.2
-----

 * Components of a compact symbol can be executable, apart from
   hashes and arrays.
 * mpdm_cmp() is optimized to return 0 when comparing the same value.

1.0.1
-----

 * mpdm_cmp() now correctly compares NULL and NULL as equal.
 * %c in mpdm_sprintf() now works with Unicode (wchar_t) characters.
 * The substitution string in mpdm_sregex() now can include the
   special character & to select the matched string. To include a
   literal &, escape it with \.
