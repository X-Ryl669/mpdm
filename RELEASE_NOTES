MPDM Release Notes
==================

1.0.6
-----

 * The environment is stored in a hash called ENV in mpdm_root().
 * Under win32, the LANG environment variable is hand-built if
   noe is set.

1.0.5
-----

 * The mpdm_regex() function now accepts a new flag, `g', to match
   globally; in this case, an array of matches are returned instead
   of a string scalar.
 * The mpdm_stat() function now returns a 14 element array, with a
   newly #13 argument containing the canonicalized file name, if
   the underlying system supports it.
 * A bunch of embedded charset encoders have been implemented for
   iso8859-1, utf-16 and utf-32 with or without BOM autodetection.

1.0.4
-----

 * API Changes; const has been added wherever possible.

1.0.3
-----

 * The hashing function has changed to a less accurate but faster one.
 * There is a new, adaptive way of sweeping: if default_sweep if set
   to a negative value (different from -1), it's used as a divisor
   of the total count of values; this will be the number of values
   that will be swept on each call to mpdm_sweep(0). This way, the
   number of swept values depend on the total count.
 * New functions mpdm_set_ival() and mpdm_set_rval().
 * New function mpdm_get_filehandle().

1.0.2
-----

 * Components of a compact symbol can be executable, apart from
   hashes and arrays.
 * mpdm_cmp() is optimized to return 0 when comparing the same value.

1.0.1
-----

 * mpdm_cmp() now correctly compares NULL and NULL as equal.
 * %c in mpdm_sprintf() now works with Unicode (wchar_t) characters.
 * The substitution string in mpdm_sregex() now can include the
   special character & to select the matched string. To include a
   literal &, escape it with \.
